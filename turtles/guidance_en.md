As pet owners, we naturally want our turtles to grow healthily. So here are some key factors that affect a turtle’s well-being.

## Temperature

As cold-blooded animals, a turtle's metabolism is closely related to the environmental temperature. When the temperature is high, turtles become active, eat and defecate well, and grow faster. Conversely, when the temperature is low, they lose their appetite and become quieter. The ideal temperature range is generally between **68°F and 91°F**.

However, it’s important to note that environmental temperature is not the same as what is displayed on a phone app. If the turtle is in water, it’s the **water temperature** that matters. If it's basking on a platform, then it’s the **temperature of the platform** that counts. Local temperatures can vary significantly, depending on whether the turtle is outdoors (whether there's shade or direct sunlight) or indoors (if the air conditioner is on, and how close the turtle is to the air vent). For example, even though the AC might be set to **79°F**, the air blowing out might actually be **64°F**. The temperature you think it feels might be very different from what the turtle actually experiences.

This leads to the first major factor affecting turtles raised at home: **temperature difference**. Just like how humans can catch a cold if they move from a hot environment to an air-conditioned room too quickly, turtles can too. Small turtles are especially sensitive to temperature differences, which can cause them to refuse food, catch colds, or even develop pneumonia. If not treated in time, it’s very hard to save them. So please be extremely cautious!

As mentioned earlier, turtles are cold-blooded and can adapt to their environment. But **temperature difference** is not the same as **temperature**; the focus is on the **difference**.

We need to prevent turtles from being exposed to two drastically different temperatures in a short time. For example, the turtles I keep on my balcony experience a temperature difference of about **18°F** throughout the day, but since the outdoor temperature changes slowly, it's not a big issue. Water, as a medium, also absorbs and releases heat, providing some buffering.

There are three common sources of temperature differences:

- **Air Conditioning**: If you turn on the AC indoors, there might be a sudden gust of cold air, causing the temperature to drop rapidly. When you turn it off, the temperature rises again. This is dangerous. It’s safer to place the turtle in a location where the cold air doesn’t directly blow, like under a bed. But if the turtle is near the AC vent, it’s almost certain to die.

- **Water Changes**: Sometimes, when changing the water, the original water temperature might be **79°F**, but the water from the tap is **68°F**. If you pour it directly over the turtle, it could be disastrous.

- **Basking Platform**: When a turtle is on a basking platform, its lower half is in the water, while its upper half is in the air. In summer, both the water and the air are warm, but in autumn, the air might get colder. So, in autumn, it’s better to keep the platform submerged. This way, even when the turtle is basking, it stays mostly in the water, which is safer. Here's a diagram to illustrate:

## Water Depth

Turtles like the Red-eared slider and Chinese pond turtles can live both on land and in water. However, remember that turtles breathe with their lungs, so they need to surface for air occasionally; they cannot stay submerged like fish.

As semi-aquatic turtles, water is essential for them. If they are kept dry for too long and are not allowed to soak in water, their shells can lose their luster or even become deformed, which looks bad.

Taking these points into account, there’s a basic rule for beginner turtle keepers: "Water over the shell, with a basking platform." This means the water should be deep enough to cover the turtle’s shell, and there should also be a basking platform where the turtle can rest and breathe easily without swimming. Some people keep turtles like Red-eared sliders in very deep water but don’t provide a basking platform, forcing the turtle to swim continuously, which is pitiful.

However, this rule is just the bare minimum. If possible, the water depth can be a bit deeper, and as long as there’s a basking platform, water depth between **8-12 inches** is fine. Deeper water has the following benefits:

- **Reduces temperature differences**: Water has a high specific heat capacity, so it buffers temperature changes. The more water there is, the better the buffering effect. An extreme example is the ocean: while the land experiences significant temperature changes between day and night, ocean temperatures remain relatively stable.

- **Stabilizes water quality**: The larger the volume of water, the more stable the water quality. If a turtle defecates in a small water tank, the water can become dirty and smelly quickly. In a larger tank, the water can stay cleaner for a longer time.

- **Improves quality of life**: In shallow water, turtles are always touching the ground with all four limbs and have no opportunity to swim. Not only do they lack exercise, but their mental health may also suffer.
